    <p>Veganism is an ideology that rejects the commodification/exploitation of animals in an effort to 
        extend moral consideration to all sentient beings. This involves abstaining from the consumption of 
        animal-based products and services in any form, including food, clothing, entertainment, or anything 
        else. Sentience is the key characteristic that differentiates animals from plants. It is the ability
         to experience feelings and sensations, including the capacity to suffer. All sentient beings are
          individuals!<br><br>

          Speciesism is the assumption of human superiority leading to the exploitation of 
          animals. We already recognize that humans deserve moral consideration in the form of rights 
          protecting us from unjustified violence. No matter how different one human is from another,
           we should all be able live in peace, free from actions that violate our rights. With this in mind, 
           animals are often used, abused, and killed by humans due to flawed logic claiming that certain 
           differences they possess (traits) allows us to disregard them as individuals and prevent the
            extension of legal rights to them. Other animals should be granted legal rights!
             The same logic and reasoning is used to justify homophobia, racism, sexism,
              and all other forms of bigotry and discrimination.</p>
